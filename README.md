## Good old FTB Infinity Evolved but updated to 1.12.2!

Infinity Evolved is an all purpose modpack created by the FTB Team, 6 and a half years ago already. This modpack is a general-purpose modpack containing more than 180 mods. It is designed for an average player, who wants all kinds of mods of different styles. Due to it still being a popular modpack but outdated, this one is updated to 1.12.2. An Infinity Evolved 2 if you will. Retaining almost all features of the original 1.7.10 version, even __Expert mode__!
